	<p>I was born in the mountains of West Virginia and raised in the forests of New Jersey. Trekked to Ohio as a teen and settled toward the center to grow. 
	Education and Dreams in hand, New York's gravity drew me in to expand.</p>

	<p>Peanut butter, turkey sandwiches, and pizza will get you far.</p>
	___

	<p>I've always been a risk taker. Focusing mostly on brand personalities and creating distinct brand personas throughout my education. I love the Idea of giving a business or company a personality, something that people can connect with.</p>

	<p>Remember to be a human. We all strive for similar things in different places.</p>

	<p>I really enjoy working for smaller agencies. I strive when surrounded by other</p> creatives, but I also take pride in bringing new ideas to old places.

	<p>I'm excited to work hard and improve my skills, while hopefully meeting some awesome people along the way.</p>
